    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      I created The Date Deck because I want inspire others to deepen their
      connection with loved ones in new ways. I know life gets busy and
      maintaining relationships is difficult. Instead of spending time planning
      a date, The Date Deck will do it for you.
